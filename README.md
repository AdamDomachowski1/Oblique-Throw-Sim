# Oblique-Throw-Sim
Program is meant to simulate an oblique throw of a mass point, taking into account the force of air resistance. The visual simulation to work needs [PyGame](https://www.pygame.org/news) but if you don't need visual simulation just remove method simulate(). Ultimately program will wirte down datas to text file.
